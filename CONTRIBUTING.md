Hi,

This script started out as a fork of another script I stumbled upon -  [eslint-prettier-airbnb-react](https://github.com/paulolramos/eslint-prettier-airbnb-react), while learning React with a desire for an enhanced DX - automatic fixing of lint errors, formatting with prettier - the works.

So I began to tinker with the aforementioned script, to make it play well with `create-react-app` in Visual Studio Code (the editor I've settled on).

As the amount of stuff the script did eventually grew, and its coupling with `create-react-app` and Visual Studio Code became tighter, it felt like this should be its own thing.

I am sure I am a total noob in shell scripting. So of course, I am completely open and welcome to have others contribute to this project.

If you would like improve this shell script (or any other part of this repo), you can:

1. Fork this repo.
2. Create a new branch and make your local commits with clear messages, limiting a single commit to 1 specific issue.
3. Create a pull request with an explanation.
4. The pull request will be reviewed and merged to the master branch if everything looks good.

Thanks for stopping by!
