## Origin Story
This script started out as a fork of another script I stumbled upon -  [eslint-prettier-airbnb-react](https://github.com/paulolramos/eslint-prettier-airbnb-react), while learning React with a desire for an enhanced DX - automatic fixing of lint errors, formatting with prettier - the works.

So I began to tinker with the aforementioned script, to make it play well with `create-react-app` in Visual Studio Code (the editor I've settled on).

As the amount of stuff the script did eventually grew, and its coupling with `create-react-app` and Visual Studio Code became tighter, it felt like this should be its own thing.
