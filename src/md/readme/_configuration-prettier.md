## Formatting with Prettier
### `prettierrc(.js/.json)`
What the script initiates:
```js
{
  "printWidth": (SET BY USER),
  "singleQuote": true
}
```
Two other options that I was used to specifying earlier, but have since Prettier v2, become defaults. 
```js
"arrowParens" : "always",
"trailingComma" : "es5"
```
- To know what each option does and for more options, refer the [Prettier docs](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html)
