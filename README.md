# Features
#### üé® Automatic linting and formatting with ESlint and Prettier in VS Code 
#### üö¶PropTypes for run-time type checking [optional]
#### üé≠Ô∏è Faker.js for fake data [optional]
#### üåê A local mock API server [optional]
#### üêïÔ∏è Axios to make HTTP requests [optional]

# Installation
1. Create a new react app
    ```bash
    npx create-react-app my-app
    ```

2. Navigate to your app directory where you want to include this style configuration.
    ```bash
    cd my-app
    ```

3. Run this command inside your app's root directory. Note: this command executes the `create-react-app-plus.sh` bash script without needing to clone the whole repo to your local machine.

    ```bash
    exec 3<&1;bash <&3 <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atej/create-react-app-plus/master/create-react-app-plus.sh 2> /dev/null)
    ```

4. Follow the prompts and make selections for your preference of package manager (npm or yarn), file format (.js or .json), max-line size, `prop-types` installation, `faker` installation, and whether to set up a mock API server.

5. Look in your project's root directory and notice the newly added/updated config files/folders:
    - `.eslintrc.js` (or `.eslintrc.json`) - eslint config file
    - `.prettierrc.js` (or `.prettierrc.json`) - prettier config file
    -  `.vscode/settings.json` - editor settings for the current workspace
    - `mock-api/app.js` - The entry point for your mock API server (if option to mock an API was selected while executing script)

6. Start the react app server
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
    or, start the react app and mock API server together
    ``` bash
    npm run dev
    ```

# Packages
## Developer Experience
### ESLint & Prettier
#### Main packages
- [eslint](https://eslint.org/) - Find and fix problems in your JavaScript code.
- [prettier](https://prettier.io/) - Prettier is an opinionated code formatter.

> Note: The latest version of eslint supported by `create-react-app` is installed (currently, `^6.6.0`)

#### Airbnb configuration
- [eslint-config-airbnb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb) - This package provides Airbnb's .eslintrc as an extensible shared config.
- [eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y) (Peer Dependency) - Static AST checker for accessibility rules on JSX elements.
- [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react) (Peer Dependency) - React specific linting rules for ESLint
- [eslint-plugin-import](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-import) (Peer Dependency) - Support linting of ES2015+ (ES6+) import/export syntax, and prevent issues with misspelling of file paths and import names.
- [babel-eslint](https://github.com/babel/babel-eslint) - A wrapper for Babel's parser used for ESLint. Included to support experimental but popular JS features like [class fields](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/Public_class_fields). Also, [Airbnb Style Guide uses Babel](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript#airbnb-javascript-style-guide-).

#### ESLint, Prettier Integration
- [eslint-plugin-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-plugin-prettier) - Runs Prettier as an ESLint rule and reports differences as individual ESLint issues.
- [eslint-config-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier) - Turns off all rules that are unnecessary or might conflict with Prettier.
   
#### ESLint extension for VS Code
- The [ESLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) must be installed and enabled manually. The script does not handle the installation.

## React stuff
### Type checking
- [prop-types](https://github.com/facebook/prop-types) - Runtime type checking for React props and similar objects

## Mocks
### Fake data
- [faker](https://github.com/Marak/Faker.js) - Generate massive amounts of realistic fake data in Node.js and the browser
### Mock API server
- [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) - Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for node. 
- [connect-api-mocker](https://github.com/muratcorlu/connect-api-mocker) - Connect middleware that creates mocks for REST APIs

## Data fetching
- [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) - Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
## NPM stuff
### Script runners
- [npm-run-all](https://github.com/mysticatea/npm-run-all) - A CLI tool to run multiple npm-scripts in parallel or sequential.

# Created Configuration Files

Configuration files are created when you first run the script. You may subsequently edit them to your liking.

## Linting with ESLint
### `eslintrc(.js/.json)`

What the script initiates:
```js
{
  "parser": "babel-eslint",
  "extends": [
    "airbnb",
    "plugin:prettier/recommended",
    "prettier/react"
  ],
  "env": {
    "browser": true,
    "commonjs": true,
    "es6": true,
    "jest": true,
    "node": true
  },
  "rules": {
    "react/state-in-constructor": ["error", "never"],
    "max-len": [
      "warn",
      {
        "code": (SET BY USER),
        "tabWidth": 2,
        "comments": (SET BY USER),
        "ignoreComments": false,
        "ignoreTrailingComments": true,
        "ignoreUrls": true,
        "ignoreStrings": true,
        "ignoreTemplateLiterals": true,
        "ignoreRegExpLiterals": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
- If you're curious about the choice made for `react/state-in-constructor`, it's an opinion I conveniently borrowed from [here.](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/issues/1810#issuecomment-395235563)
- For more info, refer the [ESLint docs.](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring)

## Formatting with Prettier
### `prettierrc(.js/.json)`
What the script initiates:
```js
{
  "printWidth": (SET BY USER),
  "singleQuote": true
}
```
Two other options that I was used to specifying earlier, but have since Prettier v2, become defaults. 
```js
"arrowParens" : "always",
"trailingComma" : "es5"
```
- To know what each option does and for more options, refer the [Prettier docs](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html)


## Auto-fix in Visual Studio Code
### `.vscode/settings.json`
- eslint extension settings
- emmet support in jsx
```json
{
  "eslint.packageManager": (SET BY USER),
  "eslint.format.enable": true,
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint",
  "editor.formatOnPaste": true,
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "emmet.includeLanguages": {
    "javascript": "javascriptreact"
  }
}
```
- **IMPORTANT**: This [ESLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) mast be installed and enabled in your workspace. 
- **Disable** the VS Code **Prettier** plugin in your workspace, if you have it enabled. Code will be both auto-formatted and auto-linted on save by the ESLint extension.

## Mocking a REST API with Express & Connect API Mocker
### `mock-api/app.js`
```js
const express = require('express');
const apiMocker = require('connect-api-mocker');

const port = 9000;
const app = express();

app.use('/api', apiMocker('mock-api'));

console.log(`Mock API Server is up and running at: http://localhost:${port}`);
app.listen(port);
```

## Origin Story
This script started out as a fork of another script I stumbled upon -  [eslint-prettier-airbnb-react](https://github.com/paulolramos/eslint-prettier-airbnb-react), while learning React with a desire for an enhanced DX - automatic fixing of lint errors, formatting with prettier - the works.

So I began to tinker with the aforementioned script, to make it play well with `create-react-app` in Visual Studio Code (the editor I've settled on).

As the amount of stuff the script did eventually grew, and its coupling with `create-react-app` and Visual Studio Code became tighter, it felt like this should be its own thing.

Without these shoulders to stand on, this mini-project would not have seen the light of day.
